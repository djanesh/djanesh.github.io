      <description>In this blogpost, I am going to take the earthquake data from April 2015 to May 2016 throughout the World. Then we will process the data in usable form and look at the data on Nepal. Later, we will also dive into the casualties from this devastating earthquake. We will look at how many people died, got injured from which district, using ggplot2, wordcloud and leaflet package.</description>

      <description>This is my first blog on data science topics. In this blog post, I will show you how to import the data from fantasy premier league into R and perform exploratory data analysis. ————-
The questions that came up in my mind before doing this analysis are:
How has Wayne Rooney been performing for the last several years ?How do Romelu Lukaku, Sergio Aguero, Harry Kane line up side by side ?</description>
